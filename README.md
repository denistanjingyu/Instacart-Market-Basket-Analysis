# Instacart Market Basket Analysis
The retail grocery industry in the United States faces a precarious economic environment. Due 
primarily to competition from warehouse clubs, supercenters, and e-commerce, retail grocery sales 
have underperformed the U.S. retail sector and the overall U.S. economy, and employment growth 
in the industry has been stagnant. Yet, a large proportion of consumers maintain a strong 
preference for shopping at retail grocery stores, and total grocery industry sales and employment 
still exceed sales and employment at warehouse clubs/supercenters and e-commerce retailers. To 
compete in this setting, many retail grocers are turning to third-party online grocery delivery 
services offering online shopping and same-day grocery delivery, the largest of which is Instacart. 
Our team came up with a business problem in which after solving, can help the online grocery 
stores in managing their business to gain an edge over the market. The specific business problem 
is to drive higher sales volume and customer retention. 
The solution involves using association ruling to find out which products were frequently bought 
together. The solution is successful in solving both the business and analytics problems, while 
providing unique and insightful methods for the online grocery stores to gain an edge over their 
competitors and at the same time, incorporating analytical tools and technology to improve their 
efficiency and productivity, providing value for all stakeholders.
